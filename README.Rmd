__bertini__ is an R package that provides methods and data structures for [numerical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algebraic_geometry), the numerical solution to (nonlinear) systems of polynomial equations using homotopy continuation.


It is still experimental, but the core functionality in the zero-dimensional case is quite stable.


_Note: the following assumes you have [Bertini](https://bertini.nd.edu) and bertini recognizes its path. To do this properly, see `?set_bertini_path()`._

```{r load}
library("bertini")
```




## Basic usage

```{r basic-usage}
code <- "
INPUT

variable_group x, y;
function f, g;

f = x^2 + y^2 - 1;
g = y - x;

END;
"
bertini(code)
```



## Solving zero-dimensional systems of polynomial equations

`poly_solve()` is the basic workhorse for solving systems of polynomial equations. For example, if we want to solve the system $y = x$ and $x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$, which corresponds geometrically to the points where the identity line intersects the unit circle, we can use:

```{r poly-solve}
poly_solve(c("y = x", "x^2 + y^2 = 1"), varorder = c("x", "y"))
```




## Polynomial optimization over compact varieties

`poly_optim()` can be used to find the critical points of polynomials over varieties.  For example, if we want to find the maximum value of the function $f(x,y) = x + y$ over the unit circle:

```{r poly-optim}
poly_optim("x + y", "x^2 + y^2 = 1")
```
